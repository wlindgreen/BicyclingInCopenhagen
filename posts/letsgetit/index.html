      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As you might have heard, Copenhagen has in recent years been ranked the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Latest in 2021 where Copenhagen was placed ahead of other European cities like Tallinn, Amsterdam and Helsinki according to the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/cycle-cities">Cycle Cities Report</a> compiled by <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/">money.co.uk</a>. Copenhagen has fostered a bicycle culture unlike many other cities in the world, where people look strangely at you if you do not own a bike. Larger bicycle path extensions, <a href="https://supercykelstier.dk/english/">cycle superhighways</a>, innovative solutions, bike bridges and much more have contributed to Copenhagen being the top city to ride a bike. In addition to the health benefits of choosing the bike over the car, the bike is also a much more sustainable means of transport. Improved conditions for cyclists, which create greater demand for cycling, will therefore also contribute to a greener world.</p>
<p>The site aims to give you a broader perspective and view of how Copenhageners use the bicycle paths. Moreover, the site presents machine learning models, which can give an indication of factors that influences the number of cyclists on a given day. Hopefully, you will get answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you avoid the rush hour on the bike paths?</li>
<li>In which season and months are cycling most popular?</li>
<li>What effect do the so-called cycle superhighways have on the bicycle demand on a route?</li>
<li>Does the weather affect Copenhageners&rsquo; cycling habits, or maybe the petrol price?</li>
<li>How much pressure on the bike paths can we expect in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>As Copenhageners we might have a perception of the bicycling behaviour, but does it aligns with reality. If we the above have caught you attention, you are encourage to get a cop of coffee, soda or beer and continue reading. <strong>Link to notebook</strong></p>

<h2 id="a-dataset-with-a-lot-of-errors">A dataset with a lot of errors</h2>
<p><strong>Short descriptions of missing values with table and so on.</strong></p>
<p>A dataset of bicycle counts for 13 counting stations in Copenhagen for the period 2005 to 2014 is the basis for the examination.</p>
<p>The map below gives an overview of the 13 counting stations.
<em>If you are unsure about the exact location just click the bike symbols. You can also view the map in full screen by the button in the top-left corner.</em></p>

<h1 id="bicycle-patterns-in-copenhagen">Bicycle patterns in Copenhagen</h1>
<p>As a commuter, you might have an assumption of when to go to work or school in the morning to avoid too many fellow road users, no matter if you travel by car, bike, or public transport. You might also be less willing to jump on your bike in January compared to June due to inferior weather conditions. In the following, you will see the temporal patterns for bicyclists in Copenhagen throughout the day, week and year. <em>Perhaps you might be surprised!</em></p>
<h3 id="daily-patterns">Daily patterns</h3>
<p>As illustrated in the figure below, which shows the daily average bicycle counts each hour, there are two peak periods on the Copenhagen bike paths: One during the morning which peaks between 8 and 9 and one during the afternoon which peaks between 16 and 17. It is clear that the afternoon rush hour extends over a longer period of time. This can both be due to people being more flexible with their closing time or because the Copenhageners have leisure activities after school and work.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Daily_h.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</figure>

<p>If you are an A-person and want the bike path almost for yourself, then just leave before 7 – otherwise, you might encounter a whole lot of shoulders on your way!</p>
<p>One could also expect the daily bicycle patterns to be completely different when considering an average weekday or day at the weekend. The figure below exemplifies this. <em>You can hover the different points to get the percentage of the total counts for weekdays or weekends</em>.</p>

<p>On a weekday we have two major morning and afternoon peaks, and at the weekend the number of cyclists is spread out during the day. Another interesting remark that appears from the figure above, is the greater number of cyclists at night at the weekend compared to a normal weekday. People are probably being out for a longer time at the weekend, having a great time and partying as fewer people have errands or work the day after.</p>
<p>So far, the average number of cyclists has been shown aggregated per hour for the different locations in Copenhagen. You might be interested in seeing how the number of counts varies for the different locations. Here you are, the following time map gives you an overview of the pressure on the bike paths in different places in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>As expected, the pressure is largest in the city centre. At Christianshavn (Torvegade) we observe the most cyclists in the morning and afternoon peak hours while the least is observed at the municipal border. Note how small some of the circles become in the night hours - it is not in the night the Wolt delivery boys deliver food to the hungry Danes.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-patterns">Weekly patterns</h3>
<p>We have seen that number of cyclists in Copenhagen is dependent on the time of day but does the number also depend on the time of the week? The figure below indicates different hourly patterns when scrutinising the hour of the week.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Weekly_h.png"/>
</figure>

<p>As the arrows point out the number of cyclists on a Friday between 14 and 15 and 17 and 18 is nearly the same contrary to the other four weekdays. This indicates that the Copenhageners leave earlier from work and school on Fridays. You could expect that some people take an after-work beer, but in general, we see the opposite where people instead want to get off as early as possible.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding from the figure above is that the Copenhageners are slower in getting started with the day on their bikes on Sundays compared to Saturdays. It appears that the blue bars have moved one hour to the right starting from 11 on Saturdays and 12 on Sundays. You could try to think about it yourself - are you lazier on a Sunday?</p>
<h3 id="seasonal-patterns">Seasonal patterns</h3>
<p>We all know that the commitment to cycle in the rain is less than to cycle in the sun. Unless you are a true Viking. The figure below shows the seasonal patterns of the average daily bicycle counts on a monthly level.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Seasonal_m.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</figure>

<p>It can be inferred that,</p>
<ul>
<li>The bicycle demand grows each month from January to June as the temperature increases.</li>
<li>Most people are on holiday in July.</li>
<li>The bicycle demand peaks in September - a month when people have grown accustomed to travelling by bike and the weather is still decent in Denmark.</li>
<li>Overall the Copenhageners tend to cycle less in the colder winter season and most in the erratic autumn season.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be surprised that there is more cycling in the fall than in the spring. There may be several explanations for this. It could be more demanding for an individual to change behaviour and it most often takes time to change habits, which thus also applies to the choice of means of transport. The weather might also influence the individual to get on the bike. The average temperature is around 2.5 °C higher in the Autumn with an average temperature of 10.1 °C compared to the spring of 7.6 °C based on the <a href="https://www.dmi.dk/vejrarkiv/manedens-sasonens-og-arets-vejr/tekst-kort-og-nogletal-sason/">ten-year average in Copenhagen</a>. Although the sun shines more in the spring and there are fewer rainy days, it seems that Copenhageners do not mind cycling in rainy weather, as long as it is not too cold. <em>This will be examined in more detail at a later stage.</em></p>
<h3 id="yearly-development">Yearly development</h3>
<p>By now, different visualizations have shown revealed temporal patterns for the average bicycle counts in Copenhagen. The following shows how the bicycle counts have changed from the year 2006 to the year 2014 (2005 is omitted due to lack of representativeness, c.f. the Explainer Notebook).</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Yearly_y.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</figure>

<p>An increase of around 71 % can be seen from the year 2006 to 2014, which is an average annual percentage increase of about 9%. Though the yearly development fluctuates throughout the years, which could be due to the weather conditions, political initiatives, road work etc., we see a slow linear increase in the number of cyclists in Copenhagen. From 2010 to 2014 the number of cyclists increases with 36 %. A similar increase is also revealed from the Danish Road Directorates bicycle index in the same period with <a href="https://www.vejdirektoratet.dk/tema/cykler-paa-vejene">an increase of 25 %</a> in the whole of Denmark. This shows that the development of bicycle traffic in Copenhagen is moving faster than in the rest of Denmark.</p>
<h1 id="cycle-superhighways">Cycle Superhighways</h1>
<p>The Cycle Superhighways is one of Copenhagen&rsquo;s flagships within bicycle projects in recent years. Connecting the suburbs with downtown Copenhagen using larger lanes and green waves, is what the project stands for. With the first two routes opening back in 2012 and 2013, it opens up the question, how did the Superhighways influence the bicycle demand on the routes and the adjacent areas?</p>
<h3 id="farumruten">Farumruten</h3>
<p>The first pertinent route is Farumruten, which connects Copenhagen with Farum, a town 20 km Northeast of the Danish capital The route was finished back in 2013. The first and second parts of the route ended at the boundary of the Municipality of Copenhagen and did not directly improve the infrastructure in central Copenhagen. The map below shows the route and the nearest counting stations.</p>

<p>The figures below show the average daily bicycle counts for the three counting stations shown at the map above. The results are shown for years up to the beginning of the construction, during the two construction periods and after the implementation.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/FR_dev.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>
</figure>

<p>A clear connection between the implementation of the route and the increase in average daily counts for the counting point Hareskovvej can be observed. In fact, that is the only location shown that is directly on the route of Farumruten. The other two points represent areas closer to the Copenhagen downtown where the expansion of the route was planned to be implemented after 2014. The results show us that the Farumruten has attracted cyclists directly to the new route, but it can not be concluded that the Cycle Superhighway have a direct impact on the traffic deeper into the city of Copenhagen.</p>
<h3 id="albertslundruten">Albertslundruten</h3>
<p>The second relevant route is Albertslundruten, which connects a suburb municipality west of Copenhagen with the city centre. As opposed to the Farumruten, the Albertslundruten was built in 2012 and went all the way into the centrum of Copenhagen. The two exanimated counting stations are not directly placed on the route but cover nearby areas as seen on the map.</p>
<iframe src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/folium_html/folium_AR.html"

<p>The average daily bicycle counts for the two counting stations throughout the years are shown below. <em>Zoom in to follow the Cycle Superhighway from Albertslund to Vesterbro</em></p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/AR_dev.png" width="70%" height="50%"/>
</figure>

<p>It can be inferred that both counting stations at Åbolevarden and Roskildevej are experiencing a change in the average daily count after the implementation of the route. For Åboulevard there is a high increase, which can relate to the fact that it covers an area close to the end of the route in the centrum of Copenhagen.  On the other hand, Roskildevej experience a decrease in the cycle demand after the implementation, while there is a large increase during the construction period. The counting station is located in the middle of the route on a parallel stretch nearby the new route. There is a high probability of the bicycle counting at Roskildevej has been affected by both the construction of Alberslundruten demonstrated by an increase in the demand and after the implementation demonstrated by a decrease in the demand.</p>
<p>To sum up, the examination has shown that some locations located directly on the route and roads in nearby areas experience a clear increase in the average daily counts when implementing Cycle Superhighways.  It is almost impossible to specify what proportion is due to the new Cycle Superhighways without considering other minor infrastructure upgrades and bicycle-related initiatives, but it is clear that the new Cycle Superhighways had some influence on bicycle traffic in those specific locations. To back up the study, the secretariat of Cycle Superhighways has also evaluated the impact of the new routes. Regarding Farumruten, the Hareskovvej area is part of the route <a href="https://supercykelstier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Evaluering-af-Farumruten-etape-1-og-2.pdf">with the largest total increase in the number of bicycles between 2012 and 2018</a>, which reflects the observed effects shown above. For Albertslundruten there are no data on the changes from the counting stations, <a href="https://supercykelstier.dk/rute/albertslundruten/">but the route has increased the bicycle numbers by 55%</a>, which confirms the assumption made based on the results of the study that Cycle Superhighways lead to a greater bicycle demand for these specific routes - thankfully&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="predictions">Predictions</h1>
<p>Until now, several aspects of cycling in Copenhagen have been presented, all of which provided an interesting insight into a world-renowned cycling culture. Now is the time to use this knowledge to predict what is important for cycling in Copenhagen as well as predict how much pressure we can expect on the bike paths of Copenhagen in the future. Since we know that you are extremely excited about the results, the boring explanation about the Machine Learning Models will be kept short, and then you can always refer to the <a href="xx">Notebook</a> if you strive for more insights. Two models have been tested: a <em>Random Forrest Regressor</em> and a <em>Multiple Linear Model</em>. The former has been used to determine the importance of different factors that could influence bicycling in Copenhagen and the latter has been utilized to predict the number of cyclists at one of the major gateways to the city centre, Åboulevarden. Both models are <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-versus-regression-in-machine-learning/">regression models</a>, which enables to predict a continuous quantity – in this case, the average daily bicycle counts. The models have been built around a data set containing possible determinants including, weather conditions, weekends/weekdays, the petrol price as well as the year and month. These are all assessed to have a possible impact on the daily cycle number.</p>
<h3 id="what-influences-ones-choice-to-commute-by-bike">What influences one’s choice to commute by bike?</h3>
<p>The <em>Random Forrest Regressor</em> resulted in some both expected and surprising findings. The figure below gives an overview of the magnitude of the features in the model that have an impact on the daily bicycling in Copenhagen.</p>
<p><strong>Figure</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly whether it is a day at the weekend or on a weekday have the greatest impact on the daily bicycle numbers at Åboulevarden. As presented earlier there is a huge difference in the bicycle counts depending on if it is a weekday where most people commute to work or a weekend where most people relax.</p>
<p>What is more interesting is that the temperature has a significant influence on the daily bicycle count and that the two other weather conditions do not seem to have such a big impact. Therefore, the model indicates that the temperature on a day (which also depends on the season) has a much greater influence on Copenhageners&rsquo; use of the bicycle compared to rain and wind conditions. It is possible that people have put their bikes on the shelf when it gets colder, but it may also be that Copenhageners do not give a fig and defy rain, wind, and sleet on their iron horses. <em>How do you choose a means of transport if it rains?</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the petrol price does not seem to have any significant effect on bicycling in Copenhagen. This is most likely because motorists value their car very highly and increased petrol prices do not outweigh the ease and freedom of choosing the car. In addition, gasoline prices make up only a small portion of the total cost of owning a car. However, it would be interesting to examine how the current petrol prices might affect the means of transport - perhaps increasing petrol prices occurring at the moment would indicate something else?</p>
<h3 id="bicycling-in-the-future">Bicycling in the future</h3>
<p>Fortunately, we have saved the most exciting part at the end. First, the final <em>Multiple Linear Model</em> showed how the different factors influenced the daily bicycle counts at Åbolevarden. The expectations for the average daily bicycle count based on the model are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average number of daily cyclists increases with the years.</li>
<li>You could expect way more cyclists on a weekday compared to the weekend.</li>
<li>An increase in the number of cyclists when the temperature rises and a minor decrease in the number of cyclists the more it rains and the wind blows.</li>
<li>A decrease in the number of cyclists in the holiday months of July and December compared to January/February.</li>
<li>An increase in the number of cyclists in the other months compared to January/February with September being the month where most cyclists could be expected.</li>
<li>The petrol price does not seem to have a significant effect on the daily bicycle counts.
The above is not surprising but supports what has been shown previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the model some predictions for the years 2010 to 2030 have been set up in order to hoe many cyclists you could expect at Åboulevarden in the future. The two tabs below give you the opportunity to investigate the expected number of cyclists at Åbolevarden on an average day in an average year (A) or in an average month of the year (B).</p>
<p><em>You are encouraged to zoom in to see how the number fluctuates each month or maybe hover over the line to see the percentage increase from 2010.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: The blue line is the predicted mean (regression line), the orange band is the 95 % confidence interval, whereas the red band is the 95 % prediction interval.</em></p>
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/confidence-intervals-vs-prediction-intervals-7b296ae58745">95 % Confidence Interval and 95 % Prediction Inteval</a> shows the great uncertainty when predicting the future, and how the uncertainty increases with the years. It is important that you as a reader are aware of the uncertainties when predicting the future.</p>
<p>By inspecting the first figure (A), which illustrates the expected average daily bicycle count at Åboulevarden annually, a slowly ascending development is observed. The annual percentage increase is around 7.5 %, which results in a growth of app. 150 % from the year 2010 to the year 2030. A quite impressive but realistic prediction.</p>
<p>The second figure (B), which illustrates the expected average daily bicycle count at Åboulevarden at a monthly level presents the seasonal fluctuations. As shown above the bicycle demand peaks every year in September and the tendency of people to be off in July also appears.</p>
<p>The results indicate a yearly increase of around 7.5 % with a maximum number of cyclists in September 2030 of around 26.000. Decisionmakers can utilize such models to ensure that the Copenhagen bicycle paths can keep up with the demand so that Copenhagen can become an even greener and even more superior city to cycle around in.</p>
<h1 id="summing-up">Summing up</h1>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>However, one important note to bring from here is the reasonable large uncertainty with the conducted analysis and every conclusion made should not be overemphasized for your future life although we hope the website has given you the next topic of conversation at the dinner table.</p>
