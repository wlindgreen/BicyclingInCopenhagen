      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As you might have heard, Copenhagen has in recent years been ranked the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Latest in 2021 where Copenhagen was placed ahead of other European cities like Tallinn, Amsterdam and Helsinki according to the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/cycle-cities">Cycle Cities Report</a> compiled by <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/">money.co.uk</a>. Copenhagen has fostered a bicycle culture unlike many other countries in the world, where people look strangely at you if you do not own a bike. Larger bicycle path extensions, <a href="https://supercykelstier.dk/english/">cycle superhighways</a>, innovative solutions, bike bridges and much more have contributed to Copenhagen being the top city to ride a bike. In addition to the health benefits of choosing the bike over the car, the bike is also a much more sustainable means of transport. Improved conditions for cyclists, which create greater demand for cycling, will therefore also contribute to a greener world.</p>
<p>The site aims to give you a broader perspective and view of how Copenhageners use the bicycle paths. Moreover, the site presents machine learning models, which can give an indication of factors that influences the number of cyclists on a given day. Hopefully, you will get answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you avoid the rush hour on the bike paths?</li>
<li>In which season and months are cycling most popular?</li>
<li>What effect do the so-called cycle superhighways have on the bicycle demand on a route?</li>
<li>Does the weather affect Copenhageners&rsquo; cycling habits, or maybe the petrol price?</li>
<li>How much pressure on the bike paths can we expect in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>As Copenhageners we might have a perception of the bicycling behaviour, but does it aligns with reality. If we the above have caught you attention, you are encourage to get a cop of coffee, soda or beer and continue reading.</p>

<h2 id="a-dataset-with-a-lot-of-errors">A dataset with a lot of errors</h2>
<p><strong>Short descriptions of missing values with table and so on.</strong></p>
<p>A dataset of bicycle counts for 13 counting stations in Copenhagen for the period 2005 to 2014 is the basis for the examination.</p>
<p>The map below gives an overview of the 13 counting stations.
<em>If you are unsure about the exact location just click the bike symbols.</em></p>
<h1 id="bicycle-patterns-in-copenhagen">Bicycle patterns in Copenhagen</h1>
<p>As a commuter, you might have an assumption of when to go to work or school in the morning to avoid too many fellow road users, no matter if you travel by car, bike, or public transport. You might also be less willing to jump on your bike in January compared to June due to inferior weather conditions. In the following, you will see the temporal patterns for bicyclists in Copenhagen throughout the day, week and year. <em>Perhaps you might be surprised!</em></p>
<h3 id="daily-patterns">Daily patterns</h3>
<p>As illustrated in the figure below, which shows the daily average bicycle counts each hour, there are two peak periods on the Copenhagen bike paths: One during the morning which peaks between 8 and 9 and one during the afternoon which peaks between 16 and 17. It is clear that the afternoon rush hour extends over a longer period of time. This can both be due to people being more flexible with their closing time or because the Copenhageners have leisure activities after school and work.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Daily_h.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</figure>

<p>If you are an A-person and want the bike path almost for yourself, then just leave before 7 – otherwise, you might encounter a whole lot of shoulders on your way!</p>
<p>One could also expect the daily bicycle patterns to be completely different when considering an average weekday or day at the weekend. The figure below exemplifies this. <em>You can hover the different points to get the average counts</em>.</p>

<p>On a weekday we have two major morning and afternoon peaks, and at the weekend the number of cyclists is spread out during the day. Another interesting remark that appears from the figure above, is the greater number of cyclists at night at the weekend compared to a normal weekday. People are probably being out for a longer time at the weekend, having a great time and partying as fewer people have errands or work the day after.</p>
<p>So far, the average number of cyclists has been shown aggregated per hour for the different locations in Copenhagen. You might be interested in seeing how the number of counts varies for the different locations. Here you are, the following time map gives you an overview of the pressure on the bike paths in different places in Copenhagen.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-patterns">Weekly patterns</h3>
<p>We have seen that number of cyclists in Copenhagen is dependent on the time of day but does the number also depend on the time of the week? The figure below indicates different hourly patterns when scrutinising the hour of the week.</p>
<figure><img src="/BicyclingInCopenhagen/Weekly_h.png"/>
</figure>

<p>As the arrows point out the number of cyclists on a Friday between 14 and 15 and 17 and 18 is nearly the same contrary to the other four weekdays. This indicates that the Copenhageners leave earlier from work and school on Fridays. You could expect that some people take an after-work beer, but in general, we see the opposite where people instead want to get off as early as possible.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding from the figure above is that the Copenhageners are slower in getting started with the day on their bikes on Sundays compared to Saturdays. It appears that the blue bars have moved one hour to the right starting from 11 on Saturdays and 12 on Sundays. You could try to think about it yourself - are you lazier on a Sunday?</p>
<h3 id="seasonal-patterns">Seasonal patterns</h3>
<p>We all know that the commitment to cycle in the rain is less than to cycle in the sun. Unless you are a true Viking. The figure below shows the seasonal patterns of the average daily bicycle counts on a monthly level.</p>

<p>It can be inferred that,</p>
<ul>
<li>The bicycle demand grows each month from January to June as the temperature increases.</li>
<li>Most people are on holiday in July.</li>
<li>The bicycle demand peaks in September - a month when people have grown accustomed to travelling by bike and the weather is still decent in Denmark.</li>
<li>Overall the Copenhageners tend to cycle less in the colder winter season and most in the erratic autumn season.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be surprised that there is more cycling in the fall than in the spring. There may be several explanations for this. It could be more demanding for an individual to change behaviour and it most often takes time to change habits, which thus also applies to the choice of means of transport. The weather might also influence the individual to get on the bike. The average temperature is around 2.5 °C higher in the Autumn with an average temperature of 10.1 °C compared to the spring of 7.6 °C based on the <a href="https://www.dmi.dk/vejrarkiv/manedens-sasonens-og-arets-vejr/tekst-kort-og-nogletal-sason/">ten-year average in Copenhagen</a>. Although the sun shines more in the spring and there are fewer rainy days, it seems that Copenhageners do not mind cycling in rainy weather, as long as it is not too cold. <em>This will be examined in more detail at a later stage.</em></p>
