<p>As you might have heard, Copenhagen has in recent years been ranked the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Latest in 2021 where Copenhagen was placed ahead of other European cities like Tallinn, Amsterdam and Helsinki according to the <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/cycle-cities">Cycle Cities Report</a> compiled by <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/">money.co.uk</a>. Copenhagen has fostered a bicycle culture unlike many other countries in the world, where people look strangely at you if you don’t own a bike. Larger bicycle path extensions, <a href="https://supercykelstier.dk/english/">cycle superhighways</a>, innovative solutions, bike bridges and much more have contributed to Copenhagen being the top city to ride a bike. In addition to the health benefits of choosing the bike over the car, the bike is also a much more sustainable means of transport. Improved conditions for cyclists, which create greater demand for cycling, will therefore also contribute to a greener world.</p>
<p>The site aims to give you a broader perspective and view of how Copenhageners use the cycle paths. The site also presents machine learning models, which can give an indication of factors that influences the number of cyclists on a given day. Do the weather, the petrol prices, and a given day impact a commuter’s choice of means of transport? We might have a perception of the bicycling behaviour, but does it aligns with reality. The overall goal of the site is to make you wiser about bicycle patterns in Copenhagen.</p>
